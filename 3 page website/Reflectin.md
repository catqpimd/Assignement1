Reflection. Your project should include a markdown file (.md) with a few
paragraphs describing your experience with this assignment - what you did,
what challenges you faced, things you hope to learn about in future classes,
etc. I expect this to be written candidly, like you’re writing this to a friend. If
you have any questions, want me to have certain considerations or to provide
specific feedback from me when I evaluate your assignment, this is the place
to include it. And please don’t have ChatGPT write this for you.



first things first, WOW i made so much of that unnessacerily hard for myself!

Second things second, did not realize this assignmenet was due at midnight until right now AKA 1:58 am :D
sooo sorry about that but like I havent even figured out how to turn this whole thing into a zip file yet
(I also totally have not been using github repositories to make my files ive just been doing them on my computer so gotta pray that this will transfer over easy)
 but i promise you will get this ASAP


In general I had a lot of fun with this assignement, whenever i felt like procrastinating working on the coding bits (painfully ironic btw)
I would just switch to doing something more fun like hunting down different backgrounds making the music loops that play with the timer etc

OH i should also probably include some sort of credits for everything right?

the meme image on the homepage is by me
background1 and 2 are me
but the rest of the backgrounds are from this really sick pixel artist called @waneella which is their user like everywhere

all the music was made just for this assignement by me and the background noises are old sound files from when i used to do a lot of SFX so not entirely sure where i got them? Its very possible that i recorded those as well.

but i think that covers it?

yeah so the premace of the website was basically supposed to be a more passive aggressive version of the useless web
I originally wanted to make some custom choice path websites that would really target the users but I ran out of time :/
You can kinda see remnants of that in my homepage tho! ALSO fully intended on sorting all of my files all nice and neat but as soon as I did everything got messed up so probably should have done that from the beginning but lesson learned! 

another lesson learned that you can very clearly tell if u go through my comments is i realized that i can fully just do // for commenting instead of going ctrl+k+c and realizing that halfway through was....fun.

The amount of time i spent on github and VS coding forums alone for this project has me feeling like my retnas have been seared with code
honeslty I would not be suprised if half of my commenting doesnt make sense either bc I am on some new medication rn that makes me lowkey very delirious but anyways i hope u enjoy my website and I do expect that you click through all the random links I included

Thank u and Goodnight!
